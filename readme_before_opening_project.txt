I've just sent you two .py files. The reason I included them is because I noticed something intriguing in the payload—a field called 'Action'. It seems like this field can have either 'Allow' or 'Deny' as its values.If the challenge was to also consider the action field, then python file is: “challengeWithActionValidation.py”.On the other hand, if the action field is not required to be validated, then the file is: “challengeWithoutActionValidation.py”.
